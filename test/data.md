* *As of Dec 2015, there are no more expressways in Czech Republic (they've been reassigned the classification of either motorway or road. Style these shields identically to `cz-road` for now?*

* *Name of shields for Finland don't seem to match up with actual road classifications? Seems more like: National, Main, and Regional?* 

* *Doublecheck India shields with team India.*
